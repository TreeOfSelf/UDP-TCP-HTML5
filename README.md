# UDP-TCP-HTML5

Leverage the speed of UDP packets through WebRTC, while also having the option of using TCP WebSockets in one easy package.



## Deployment

Run server.js under /server/
and the /client/ folder can be hosted on whatever HTTP hosting you prefer, use message_send_tcp, message_send_udp on server/client to send messages.
If a WebRTC connection cannot be established, it will fallback to using all TCP.
